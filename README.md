# Login-app

Welcome to my Login app!

To run the code of this project you must download VSCode,React,NodeJs and Firebase.

After downloading VSCode, you have to install NodeJs and then React.

Once React is installed you must create a new project in VSCode to run the code of the files in order to create the app.

Inside the src folder in VSCode, delete the existing files and replace them with the files that i have in my src folder.

Also inside the public folder replace the index.html file with my index.html file.
